# Plant Health Monitoring System ðŸŒ± â€” EE459 Capstone
Our AI-driven plant monitoring system is designed to enhance plant nurturing by meticulously tracking key growth factors such as temperature, soil humidity, and sunlight. Leveraging forecasting and anomaly detection, our system also monitors and predicts the growth trajectory based on historical data.  

## Project Summary
- Designed a real-time plant monitoring system using an **ATMega328P microcontroller**
- Integrated environmental sensors (light, temperature, soil moisture, humidity)
- Used **unsupervised learning** to detect deviations from normal plant conditions
- Displayed system data on an LCD and logged data via serial output
